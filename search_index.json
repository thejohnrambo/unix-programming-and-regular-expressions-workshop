History\n\nShell Scripting was developed in the context of the UNIX Operating System from Bell Labs\n\nEarly UNIX systems packed incredible power into very small machines\n\n64 Kb \"virtual\" address space for the code and for data\nThis was often less than that of physical memory on the early PDP-11S\n\n\nSource Code made it easy to experiment and change the system\nAT&T Bell Labs heavily influenced Unix by the likes of Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others\n\nQuote from Dennis Ritchie for Vision of Unix:\n\nWhat we wanted to preserve was not just a good environment in which to do programming, but a system around which a fellowship could form. We knew from experience that the essence of communal computing, as supplied by remote-access, time-shared machines, is not just to type programs into a terminal instead of a keypunch, but to encourage close communication.\n\n\nUnix Developers were the users of the system and they developed tools to solve their own problems\nUnix Developers were given freedom to experiment and rewrite Unix as needed\nUnix was designed in a quest for elegance\n\nUnix Software Philosophy\nSoftware Tools Book and Software Tools in Pascal\n\nPrograms should be like specialized tools in a carpenter's toolbox\n\nAvoid create programs to rule them all\nDon't create programs that are like a Swiss Army Knife... meaning they do too much\nOne simple example would be sorting... either you can do one of the two following things:\nWrite a bunch of programs to do various tasks, each of which has an option to sort its output\nChoose a common representation for your system (e.g. streams of ASCII text), create a mechanism for composing pieces of the system (Unix pipes), and only write the sorting functionality once\n\n\nA less simple example would be the LLVM compiler (and compilers in general), which uses an intermediate representation (IR) that is understood and operated on by all pieces of the system as the compiler does all the passes required to generate its target (e.g. lexing, parsing, optimization, code generation, etc.)\nIn general, choosing a common representation for a system will turn the problem of interfacing the various pieces from an m*n problem into an m+n problem (where m is the number of different outputs in the first stage, n is number of inputs that are received in the second stage)\n\n\nTools can be combined using pipelines and the shell to get your work done\nOne famous example is Doug McIlroy's word count program, compared to Donald Knuth's, as described here and elsewhere\n\n\nThis philosophy became popular in Kernighan & Plauger Books\nSome example presentations that discuss the Unix philosophy include:\nUnix Pipeline (Brian Kernighan) - Computerphile, which discusses the concept of the Unix pipe\nBringing the Unix Philosophy to Big Data by Bryan Cantrill, which discusses the Unix philosophy in relation to big data\nPycon UK 2016: Python and the Glories of the UNIX Tradition by Brandon Rhodes, which discusses the Unix philosophy in relation to Python\n\n\n\n\n\nDo One thing Well\nPrograms are easier to:\n\nWrite and to correct\n\nDocument\n\nUnderstand and use\n\n\nThe cat command originally only concatenated files\nThe cp command copies files\nThe mv command moves and renames files\n\n\nProcess Lines of Text\nUsing Text as the main data format has advantages:\n\nText is easy to process with existing and new tools\n\nText can be edited with any text editor\n\nText is portable across networks and machine architectures\n\n\nFor example to list some popular baby names and sort them:\ncat data/top-10-baby-names-2016.txt | awk '{print $2 }' | sort\n\nUse Regular Expressions\n\nRegular Expressions provide powerful text matching and substitution\n\n2 Flavors of regular expressions standardized by POSIX\n\nBasic Regular Expressions (BREs)\ngrep, sed, ...\n\n\nExtended Regular Expressions (EREs)\negrep, awk, ...\n\n\n\nDefault to Standard Input/Output\nUse Standard Input/Output (I/O) when there is no files on the command line:\n\nHelps simplify writing programs\nHelps you hook programs together with pipelines\nHelps encourage programs to do one thing well\n\nDon't Be Chatty\n\nStatus messages that are mixed with standard output confuse programs downstream\nIf you ask then you get it. Don't prompt with 'Are you sure'\nDo know what you are doing:\nrm -rf / Before running a command like this\nThis will delete everything starting from the root directory\n\n\nWe have version control systems such as Git use them\n\nMake sure to use the input format for output\n\nIf your text is structured then after processing\nWrite the same format for standard output in the same format of standard input\nDoing this affords you to build specialized tools that work together\n\n\n\nWrite specialized tools if they do not exist\n\nAt times a tool does not exist, that is when you need to write the tool\nCan the tool be useful to other people?\nCan the tool be generalized?\n\n\n\nIf any of the answers to these questions are yes:\n\nthen write a general purpose tool\n\n\nScripting languages can often be used to write a software tool:\n\nAwk\nPerl\nPython\nRuby\nShell\n\n\nYou can also use other languages like for example Golang as we will see\n\n\nSoftware Tools Summary\n\nUsing the software tools approach helps provide a framework and a mindset for programming and scripting\nYou can combine software tools to solve software programs\nThis strategy in turn gives you flexibility and helps promote innovation\n\n\nKnow your tools and thinking in the Software Tools Philosophy will improve your scripting\n\nSelf Contained Shell Scripts\nExecutable Definition\n\nIn computing, executable code or an executable file or executable program, sometimes simply referred to as an executable or binary, causes a computer \"to perform indicated tasks according to encoded instructions,\"[1] as opposed to a data file that must be parsed by a program to be meaningful.\n\nTypically a high level language is used that compiles to executable machine code files\n\nExecutable scripts typicall start with a Shebang => #! /bin/bash or the like\nAn optional argument can be provided\nSome Unix systems have small limits on the path name length\n\n\n\nShell Scripts can be simple executable text files that contain shell commands.\n\nKeep in mind that this only works if the shell script is in the same language as the interactive shell\nFor example to expect a zsh shell script to run in a bash environment\n\n\n\n"},"docs/basics-of-shell-programming.html":{"url":"docs/basics-of-shell-programming.html","title":"Basics of Shell

Tracing\nRedirection\nCommand Types and Searching\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\nVariables\nVariables store data.\nIf you want to get the value of a stored variable then you need to use $SOME_VARIABLE\n$ MY_JUNK_VARIABLE=JUNKY\n$ echo $MY_JUNK_VARIABLE\nJUNKY\n\nBash doesn't preserve whitespace in variables unless you use double quotes\n$ echo 'a        b'\na        b\n$ echo \"a              b\"\na              b\n$ some=\"a              b\"\n$ echo $some\na b\n$ echo \"$some\"\na              b\n\nZsh on the either hand does preserve spaces\n$ one=\"a         b\"\n$ echo $one\na         b\n$ echo \"$one\"\na         b\n\nIf you pass the -n flag to echo like this echo -n \"Type your name: \" it will not print trailing newline\n$ echo -n \"Enter your Name: \"\nEnter your Name: %\n\nNotice the % character in the prompt\n$ chmod +x scripts/basics-of-shell-programming/simple-output.sh\n$ ./scripts/basics-of-shell-programming/simple-output.sh\n\nThe $# tells you the number of arguments passed in\necho $#\n0\n\nNotice that 0 printed but that is not fixed\n$ ./scripts/basics-of-shell-programming/count-arguments.sh the number of args is\nThe number of arguments passed in this script is: 5\n\nRun the script above at the root of the repository\nDemonstrate different types of args\n$1 ... $9 will print the position of the argument\nBoth $* and $@ expand to positional parameters.\nBut $* and $@ behave differently when you use double quotes:\n\n\"$@\" expands to properly quoted arguments\n\"$*\" makes all arguments into a single argument.\n\n$ ./scripts/basics-of-shell-programming/compare-positional-parameters.sh\nArgs using $@\none\ntwo three\nfour\nArgs using $*\none two three four\n\nNotice that the $@ treated each argument that was quoted as separate while $* treated them as one argument\nAlways use double quotes when referring to variable values\nAlways use \"$*\" to refer to all command line arguments in these scenarios:\n\nProcessing arguments in a loop\nPassing arguments onto another command\n\nQuoting\n$ one=one\n$ echo $one\none\n$ echo \\$one\n$one\n\nNotice above that the backslash made echo \\$one a literal argument\n$ first_name=marcel\n$ last_name=belmont\n$ echo '$first_name $last_name'\n$first_name $last_name\n$ echo \"$first_name $last_name\"\nmarcel belmont\n$ name=\"$first_name $last_name\"\n$ echo \"My name is $name\"\nMy name is marcel belmont\n\nNotice that the variables in single quotes were treated literally while the double quotes were evaluated\nExecution Tracing\nDebugging in Bash\nExecution tracing is the main way to conduct debugging in the shell\n$ set -x\n$ echo $name\n+ echo Jean-Marcel\nJean-Marcel\n$ set +x\n+ set +x\n$ echo $name\nJean-Marcel\n\nNotice that set -x turned on execution tracing while set +x turned it off again\nRun the script ./scripts/basics-of-shell-programming/script-tracing.sh\n$ ./scripts/basics-of-shell-programming/script-tracing.sh one two three\n+ for arg in '\"$@\"'\n+ printf 'This arg is one\\n'\nThis arg is one\n+ for arg in '\"$@\"'\n+ printf 'This arg is two\\n'\nThis arg is two\n+ for arg in '\"$@\"'\n+ printf 'This arg is three\\n'\nThis arg is three\n\nNotice here that we turned on execution tracing in the shebang line with optional argument\nEach line traced each step of the script, notice that the script ran 3 times\n\nBackslash \\ will quote the following single character\nSingle Quotes are treated literally\nNo need to escape and single quotes don't do expansion\nNeed to escape embedded single quotes in single quotes\necho 'one '\\''two'\\''' => one 'two'\n\n\n\n\nDouble quotes do some expansions\nUse \\ inside \"...\" to escape the following characters:\n\"\n$\n`\n\n\n\n\nExecution Tracing helps you understand what the shell is doing on each step\n\nBest Practice for Quoting\n\nQuote text that are passed to commands\nDouble quote is almost always what you want to do\n\n\nMake sure to understand what double quote do\nExecution Tracing is the most important form of debugging in the shell\nThere is a bash debugger as well\n\n\nBash quotes arguments with metacharacters\n\nRedirection\nRedirection)\n$ cat\none\none\ntwo\ntwo\nthree\nthree\n\nHere I entered cat pressed enter then typed one and hit enter and standard output printed another one to standard output and the last three printed to standard output I pressed control d\n$ cat > colors.txt\n## Hit enter\nblue\ngreen\norange\nblack\nyellow\n## Press Control D for end of line\n\n$ cat colors.txt\nblue\ngreen\norange\nblack\nyellow\n\nNotice that we used cat and redirected the output of standard input into the file called colors.txt\n$ cat >> colors.txt\nwhite\nbash-4.4$ cat colors.txt\nblue\ngreen\norange\nblack\nyellow\nwhite\n\nNotice here that the >> operator appended elements to a file\n$ echo \"one\n> two\n> three\n> \" > numbers.txt\n\n$ cat numbers.txt\none\ntwo\nthree\n\n$ echo \"four\n> five\n> six\" > numbers2.txt\n\n$ cat numbers.txt numbers2.txt > allnumbers.txt\n\n$ cat allnumbers.txt\none\ntwo\nthree\nfour\nfive\nsix\n\n\nNotice in this shell execution we created 2 files called numbers.txt and numbers2.txt using echo command\nThen we created another file called allnumbers.txt using > redirection operator\n\n$ tr a-z A-Z  one\n> two\n> three\n> UPPER\nONE\nTWO\nTHREE\n\nNotice the tr operator which translate characters and the  operator is known as a here document\nWhen you use the  operator (here document) you need to define a literal value to delimit in this case we used UPPER\nHere Document\n$ tr a-z A-Z \nNotice that here we use  which is known as here string\nHere strings\n$ od -c allnumbers.txt\n0000000    o   n   e  \\n   t   w   o  \\n   t   h   r   e   e  \\n   f   o\n0000020    u   r  \\n   f   i   v   e  \\n   s   i   x  \\n\n0000034\n\nNotice here we used the od -- octal, decimal, hex, ASCII dump operator with -c flag to output c-style escaped characters\nDifferences with Redirection Operators\n\n is used to redirect input\n> is used to redirect output.\n>> is used to append output\n is used to read from a stream literal and behaves like a file\n is used to read a stream from a word\n| is used to feed standard output of one command as standard input for another command\n\nOther operators used in shell redirection\nTLDP Shell Redirection\n\n1> filename\n\nRedirect stdout to file \"filename.\"\n\n\n1>> filename\n\nRedirect and append stdout to file \"filename.\"\n\n\n2> filename\n\nRedirect stderr to file \"filename.\"\n\n\n2>> filename\n\nRedirect and append stderr to file \"filename.\"\n\n\n&> filename\n\nRedirect both stdout and stderr to file \"filename.\"\nThis operator is now functional, as of Bash 4, final release.\n\n\n2>&1\n\nRedirects stderr to stdout.\nError messages get sent to same place as standard output.\n\n\nfilename 2>&1\n\nbad_command >>filename 2>&1\nAppends both stdout and stderr to the file \"filename\" ...\n2>&1 | [command(s)]\nbad_command 2>&1 | awk '{print $5}'   # found\nSends stderr through a pipe.\n|& was added to Bash 4 as an abbreviation for 2>&1 |.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ni>&j\n\nRedirects file descriptor i to j.\nAll output of file pointed to by i gets sent to file pointed to by j.\n\n\n\n&j\n\nRedirects, by default, file descriptor 1 (stdout) to j.\nAll stdout gets sent to file pointed to by j.\n\n\n\n\nHere is a hello world example in the C programming Language with a syntax error\n#include \n\nint main(int argc, char **argv) {\n  printf(\"hello World\\n\")\n  return 0;\n}\n\n$ make helloWorld\ncc     helloWorld.c   -o helloWorld\nhelloWorld.c:4:26: error: expected ';' after expression\n  printf(\"hello World\\n\")\n                         ^\n                         ;\n1 error generated.\nmake: *** [helloWorld] Error 1\n\nHere we use the Make) utility which is a build automation tool to build executable programs\nWhen we run make helloWorld we get both standard output and standard error all printed in screen\n$ make helloWorld > helloWorld.out 2> helloWorld.err\n$ cat helloWorld.err\nhelloWorld.c:4:26: error: expected ';' after expression\n  printf(\"hello World\\n\")\n                         ^\n                         ;\n1 error generated.\nmake: *** [helloWorld] Error 1\n$ cat helloWorld.out\ncc     helloWorld.c   -o helloWorld\n\nNotice here we used > to redirect standard output  and 2> to redirect standard error\nOne important point is that you must redirect standard output before redirecting standard error\n$ make helloWorld 2>&1 | tee errors\n\nNotice here used 2>&1 to redirect stderr to stdout and then used the TEE command)\n\nThe tee utility copies standard input to standard output, making a copy in zero or more files.\nThe output is unbuffered.\n\n\n\n$ make helloWorld > helloWorld.out 2>&1\n\nThis command redirects standard output and standard error to a file called helloWorld.out\nPipe Operator\n✗ echo 'one two three' | tr a-z A-Z\nONE TWO THREE\n\nThe | operator used the standard output of echo to feed the tr operator and transform characters to uppercase\nPipelines in Unix)\n\nIn Unix-like computer operating systems, a pipeline is a sequence of processes chained together by their standard streams, so that the output of each process (stdout) feeds directly as input (stdin) to the next one.\n\nGood Practices in Shell Redirection\n\nRead the Fine Manual (RTFM) as necessary using man command\nCapture standard error as necessary\nThrow away standard output if you don't need it\nRedirection with , >, , , | are fundamental operators to use\nRedirecting standard error with 2>... is both powerful and useful\n\nRedirecting standard error in 3 ways:\n\nmake helloWorld > helloWorld.out 2> helloWorld.err\nThis format creates 2 separate files with > funneling standard output into a file\nand 2> funneling standard error into a file\n\n\nmake helloWorld > helloWorld.out 2>&1\nThis command sends stdout and stderr both to helloWorld.out\n\n\nmake helloWorld 2>&1 | tee helloWorld.out\nThis command uses tee to both send stdout and stderr to console and create file called helloWorld.out\n\n\n\nRedirect to /dev/null\n$ cat /etc/passwd > /dev/null\n$ echo $?\n0\n\nIn this run we threw away standard output into /dev/null and then checked exit status with $? and it ran successfully\n\nRead more about devices directory in The /dev directory\n\nCommand Types and Searching\nType Operator)\nShell Builtins\nShell Builtin\n\nIn computing, a shell builtin is a command or a function, called from a shell, that is executed directly in the shell itself, instead of an external executable program which the shell would load and execute.\n\n$ type echo\necho is a shell builtin\n\n$ type type\ntype is a shell builtin\n\nNotice here that type is used to tell what type of command we have\nShell Functions\n$ type cp\ncp is /bin/cp\n\ncp is a shell function\nShell Aliases\nShell Aliases)\n\nIn computing, alias is a command in various command line interpreters (shells) such as Unix shells, 4DOS/4NT and Windows PowerShell, which enables a replacement of a word by another string. It is mainly used for abbreviating a system command, or for adding default arguments to a regularly used command. Aliasing functionality in the MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows operating systems is provided by the DOSKey command-line utility.\n\n✗ alias\n-='cd -'\n...=../..\n....=../../..\n.....=../../../..\n......=../../../../..\n1='cd -'\n2='cd -2'\n3='cd -3'\n4='cd -4'\n5='cd -5'\n6='cd -6'\n7='cd -7'\n8='cd -8'\n9='cd -9'\n_=sudo\nafind='ack -il'\nbaidu='web_search baidu'\nbing='web_search bing'\nbrews='brew list -1'\nbubc='brew upgrade && brew cleanup'\nbubo='brew update && brew outdated'\nbubu='bubo && bubc'\nd='dirs -v | head -10'\ndcb='docker-compose build'\ndcdn='docker-compose down'\ndce='docker-compose exec'\ndcl='docker-compose logs'\ndclf='docker-compose logs -f'\ndco=docker-compose\ndcps='docker-compose ps'\ndcr='docker-compose run'\ndcrestart='docker-compose restart'\ndcrm='docker-compose rm'\ndcstop='docker-compose stop'\n...\n\nNotice here that aliases are used to make abbreviated commands\nHashed commands\n$ ls\nLICENSE                _book                docs                package.json\nREADME.md            book.json            node_modules            scripts\nSUMMARY.md            data                npm-debug.log.4075885730\n$ man bash\n$ hash\nhits    command\n   1    /usr/bin/man\n   1    /bin/ls\n\nShell Keywords\n\nA keyword is a reserved word, token or operator. Keywords have a special meaning to the shell, and indeed are the building blocks of the shell's syntax. As examples, for, while, do, and ! are keywords. Similar to a builtin, a keyword is hard-coded into Bash, but unlike a builtin, a keyword is not in itself a command, but a subunit of a command construct.\n\n$ type [\n[ is a shell builtin\n$ type [[\n[[ is a shell keyword\n\nWe will go over these later in the workshop\nShell Documentation for Builtins\nIn bash use help to get documentation for shell builtins\n$ help echo\necho: echo [-neE] [arg ...]\n    Write arguments to the standard output.\n\n    Display the ARGs, separated by a single space character and followed by a\n    newline, on the standard output.\n\n    Options:\n      -n    do not append a newline\n      -e    enable interpretation of the following backslash escapes\n      -E    explicitly suppress interpretation of backslash escapes\n\n    `echo' interprets the following backslash-escaped characters:\n      \\a    alert (bell)\n      \\b    backspace\n      \\c    suppress further output\n      \\e    escape character\n      \\E    escape character\n      \\f    form feed\n      \\n    new line\n      \\r    carriage return\n      \\t    horizontal tab\n      \\v    vertical tab\n      \\\\    backslash\n      \\0nnn    the character whose ASCII code is NNN (octal).  NNN can be\n            0 to 3 octal digits\n      \\xHH    the eight-bit character whose value is HH (hexadecimal).  HH\n            can be one or two hex digits\n\n    Exit Status:\n    Returns success unless a write error occurs.\n\nwhile in Zsh you need to use run-help to get shell builtin documentation\n$ run-help echo\n## Pager is used in my case it is LESS\necho [ -neE ] [ arg ... ]\n       Write  each  arg on the standard output, with a space separating\n       each one.  If the -n flag is not present, print a newline at the\n       end.  echo recognizes the following escape sequences:\n\n       \\a     bell character\n       \\b     backspace\n       \\c     suppress final newline\n       \\e     escape\n       \\f     form feed\n       \\n     linefeed (newline)\n       \\r     carriage return\n       \\t     horizontal tab\n       \\v     vertical tab\n       \\\\     backslash\n       \\0NNN  character code in octal\n       \\xNN   character code in hexadecimal\n       \\uNNNN unicode character code in hexadecimal\n       \\UNNNNNNNN\n              unicode character code in hexadecimal\n\n       The  -E  flag,  or  the  BSD_ECHO option, can be used to disable\n       these escape sequences.

When Bash is executing in POSIX mode, the special builtins differ from other builtin commands in three respects:\nSpecial builtins are found before shell functions during command lookup.\nIf a special builtin returns an error status, a non-interactive shell exits.\nAssignment statements preceding the command stay in effect in the shell environment after the command completes.\nWhen Bash is not executing in POSIX mode, these builtins behave no differently than the rest of the Bash builtin commands. The Bash POSIX mode is described in Bash POSIX Mode.\nThese are the POSIX special builtins:\nbreak : . continue eval exec exit export readonly return set\nshift trap unset\nI am not sure whether zsh calls break and continue special builtins\nDefining your own scripts\nThe PATH variable is used find location of binary executables\n\nOn POSIX and Unix-like operating systems, the $PATH variable is specified as a list of one or more directory names separated by colon (:) characters.\n\nPath Variable)\necho $PATH\n/Users/marcelbelmont/.gvm/bin:/Users/marcelbelmont/.nvm/versions/node/v6.11.2/bin:/Users/marcelbelmont/.local/bin:/Users/marcelbelmont/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/opt/go/libexec/bin:/usr/local/opt/openvpn/sbin:/Users/marcelbelmont/go/bin:/Users/marcelbelmont/.gvm/bin:/Users/marcelbelmont/.local/bin:/Users/marcelbelmont/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/opt/go/libexec/bin:/usr/local/opt/openvpn/sbin:/Users/marcelbelmont/go/bin:/Users/marcelbelmont/.gvm/bin:/Users/marcelbelmont/.local/bin:/Users/marcelbelmont/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:...\n\nNotice that when we echo the contents of PATH variable the local executables come first\nexport PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/opt/go/libexec/bin:$(brew --prefix openvpn)/sbin:$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\nHere is my local PATH variable\nexport PATH=\"$PATH:$HOME/.rvm/bin\"\n\nHere rvm is prepended to existing PATH variable\nGood Practices for PATH variable:\n\nYou should use a convention like $HOME:/bin to define any local scripts\nDon't use current directory as this can be used to execute malicious code like a trojan horse\nBe careful with PATH variable\nUse full paths only\nDon't use empty elements or explicit . in PATH variable\n\n\nTry to put private directories first\nUse command function to skip functions\nClear CDPATH in production environments\n\nCDPATH variable\n\nUse CDPATH to define the base directory for cd command\nNever export CDPATH from your shell to the environment.\nIf you use CDPATH then set it in your .bashrc, .zshrc file and don’t export it\nso that it’s only set in interactive shells.\n\n\n\nCDPATH=~/genesys:.\n\nNow when I try cd into directory I can cd into any folders inside of ~/genesys and it will be found\nAs I mentioned above don't do this in production because there is assumptions about directory structure here that won't necessarily be the case in a production environment\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← README\nIntroduction to Text Processing →\n\n\n\n"},"docs/introduction-to-text-processing.html":{"url":"docs/introduction-to-text-processing.html","title":"Introduction to Text Processing","keywords":"","body":"Unix Programming and Regular Expressions Workshop - Introduction to Text Processing\nSections:\n\nCounting lines, words, and characters\nTransforming Text\nTabs vs Spaces\nText extraction\nComparing Sorted Files\nScript using tr, sort, and comm\nBest Practices\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\nCounting lines, words, and characters\n\nwc command, short for word count\nThe wc utility displays the number of lines, words, and bytes contained in each input file\nor standard input (if no file is specified) to the standard output.\nA line is defined as a string of characters delimited by a  character.\nCharacters beyond the final  character will not be included in the line count.\n\n\nOutput order: count of lines, words, characters, or bytes\nDefault count is lines, words, bytes\nCharacters can be multibyte encoded\n\n\n\nwc takes the following output:\n\n-c The number of bytes in each input file is written to the standard output.  This will cancel out any prior usage of the -m option.\n-l The number of lines in each input file is written to the standard output.\n-m The number of characters in each input file is written to the standard output.\nIf the current locale does not support multibyte characters, this is equivalent to the -c option.\nThis will cancel out any prior usage of the -c option.\n\n\n-w The number of words in each input file is written to the standard output.\n\nTransforming Text\n\ntr command, short for translate characters\nThe tr utility copies the standard input to the standard output with substitution or deletion of selected characters\nThe tr command transforms text\nThe following options are available for tr:\n-C Complement the set of characters in string1, that is `-C ab'' includes every character except fora' and `b'.\n-c Same as -C but complement the set of values in string1.\n-d Delete characters in string1 from the input.\n-s Squeeze multiple occurrences of the characters listed in the last operand (either string1 or string2) in the input into a single instance of the character.\nThis occurs after all deletion and translation is completed.\n\n\n-u Guarantee that any output is unbuffered.\n\n\n\nTypical usage for tr is to map one set of values into another:\n\ntr a-z A-Z is old style\ntr [:lower:] [:upper:] is POSIX style\n\n[:class:] Represents all characters belonging to the defined character class.\nClass names are:\n\nalnum        \nalpha        \nblank        \ncntrl        \ndigit        \ngraph        \nideogram     \nlower        \nphonogram

named files or the standard input writing the standard output with tabs changed into blanks.\nBackspace characters are preserved into the output and decrement the column count for tab calculations.\nThe expand utility is useful for pre-processing character files (before sorting, looking at specific columns, etc.) that contain tabs.\nunexpand command converts spaces to tabs\nThe unexpand utility puts tabs back into the data from the standard input or the named files and writes the result on the standard output.\n\nThe following options are available for both expand and unexpand:\n\n-a (unexpand only.)\nBy default, only leading blanks and tabs are reconverted to maximal strings of tabs.\nIf the -a option is given, then tabs are inserted whenever they would compress the resultant file by replacing two or more characters.\n-t tab1,tab2,...,tabn\nSet tab stops at column positions tab1, tab2, ..., tabn.\nIf only a single number is given, tab stops are set that number of column positions apart instead of the default number of 8.\n\n\n\n\n\nod -c\none two three   4 five  six\n0000000    o   n   e       t   w   o       t   h   r   e   e  \\t   4\n0000020    f

by default, its standard input, to the standard output.\n\nThe options for tail are as follows:\n\n-b number The location is number 512-byte blocks.\n-c number The location is number bytes.\n-f The -f option causes tail to not stop when end of file is reached, but rather to wait for additional data to be appended to the input.\nThe -f option is ignored if the standard input is a pipe, but not if it is a FIFO.\n\n\n-F The -F option implies the -f option, but tail will also check to see if the file being followed has been renamed or rotated.\nThe file is closed and reopened when tail detects that the filename being read from has a new inode number.\nThe -F option is ignored if reading from standard input rather than a file.\n-n number The location is number lines.\n-q Suppresses printing of headers when multiple files are being examined.\n-r The -r option causes the input to be displayed in reverse order, by line.\n\n\n\nRead the Fine Manual for more options\nComparing Sorted Files\n\ncomm command compares two sorted files\nThe comm utility reads file1 and file2, which should be sorted lexically, and produces three text columns as output: lines only in file1; lines only in file2; and lines in both files\nThe filename - means the standard input (stdin)\n\nThe following options for comm are available:\n\n-1    Suppress printing of column 1.\n-2    Suppress printing of column 2.\n-3    Suppress printing of column 3.\n-i    Case insensitive comparison of lines.\n\nScript using tr, sort, and comm\n./scripts/introduction-to-text-processing/spell_checking.sh\n\ncont\ndat\nspele\nsumetimes\n\nNotice this script printed out the misspelled words from the text file into the screen\n./scripts/introduction-to-text-processing/spell_checking_success.sh\n\nNotice no words were printed out\nStep by step execution of the script:\n\ntr '[:space:][:punct:]' '\\n' \ntr transforms spaces and punctuation characters to a new line\n\n\ntr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' via pipeline tr transforms any Uppercase characters to lowercase\nsort -u via another pipeline we sort the text and show only unique entries\ncomm -23 - /usr/share/dict/words via the last pipeline we pass into the comm command the standard input and compare it to entries in /usr/share/dict/words\nRemember that the comm file needs to have input sorted and column 1 is content only in 1\nThe second column is content only in file 2\nThe third column is content only in both\nWe only want the content from standard input or column 1\n\n\n\nBest Practices\n\nUse POSIX options instead for portability\nUtilities that work with character sets (tr) and with sorted files (comm) are sensitive to current locale\n\nCharacter sets can vary wildly in different locales\nSimilarly files sort differently in different locales\n\n\nIf you use export LC_ALL=C you will get a traditional Unix environment\n\nTo be safe re-sort files in the current locale if the files were sorted in a different locale\nTry to utilize the power of sorting and regular expressions\nUse tr for letter case transformations and to break lines into one word per line\n\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← Basics of Shell Programming\nText Searching

expressions (regex) can be thought of as a language to describe matching text.\n\nA regular expression, regex or regexp (sometimes called a rational expression) is, in theoretical computer science and formal language theory, a sequence of characters that define a search pattern.\n\nRegular Expressions are comprised of:\n\nSome regular characters that can stand for themselves like 'a'\nMetacharacters that can stand for a regular expression operation\n\nHere is a chart on metacharacters:\n\n\n\nMetacharacter\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n^\nMatches the starting position within the string. In line-based tools, it matches the starting position of any line.\n\n\n.\nMatches any single character (many applications exclude newlines, and exactly which characters are considered newlines is flavor-, character-encoding-, and platform-specific, but it is safe to assume that the line feed character is included). Within POSIX bracket expressions, the dot character matches a literal dot. For example, a.c matches \"abc\", etc., but [a.c] matches only \"a\", \".\", or \"c\".\n\n\n[]\nA bracket expression. Matches a single character that is contained within the brackets. For example, [abc] matches \"a\", \"b\", or \"c\". [a-z] specifies a range which matches any lowercase letter from \"a\" to \"z\". These forms can be mixed: [abcx-z] matches \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"x\", \"y\", or \"z\", as does [a-cx-z]. The - character is treated as a literal character if it is the last or the first (after the ^, if present) character within the brackets: [abc-], [-abc]. Note that backslash escapes are not allowed. The ] character can be included in a bracket expression if it is the first (after the ^) character: []abc].\n\n\n[^]\nMatches a single character that is not contained within the brackets. For example, abc matches any character other than \"a\", \"b\", or \"c\". a-z matches any single character that is not a lowercase letter from \"a\" to \"z\". Likewise, literal characters and ranges can be mixed.\n\n\n$\nMatches the ending position of the string or the position just before a string-ending newline. In line-based tools, it matches the ending position of any line.\n\n\n()\nDefines a marked subexpression. The string matched within the parentheses can be recalled later (see the next entry, \\n). A marked subexpression is also called a block or capturing group. BRE mode requires ( ).\n\n\n\\n\nMatches what the nth marked subexpression matched, where n is a digit from 1 to 9. This construct is vaguely defined in the POSIX.2 standard. Some tools allow referencing more than nine capturing groups.\n\n\n*\nMatches the preceding element zero or more times. For example, abc matches \"ac\", \"abc\", \"abbbc\", etc. [xyz] matches \"\", \"x\", \"y\", \"z\", \"zx\", \"zyx\", \"xyzzy\", and so on. (ab)* matches \"\", \"ab\", \"abab\", \"ababab\", and so on.\n\n\n{m, n}\nMatches the preceding element at least m and not more than n times. For example, a{3,5} matches only \"aaa\", \"aaaa\", and \"aaaaa\". This is not found in a few older instances of regexes. BRE mode requires {m,n}.\n\n\n\n\nExpressions that denote categories of a regular expression\n\nHistory and Types of Regular Expressions\n\nRegular expressions originated in 1956, when mathematician Stephen Cole Kleene described regular languages using his mathematical notation called regular sets. These arose in theoretical computer science, in the subfields of automata theory (models of computation) and the description and classification of formal languages. Other early implementations of pattern matching include the SNOBOL language, which did not use regular expressions, but instead its own pattern matching constructs.\n\n\nDifferent Unix tools have used different Regular Expression types\nThis reflects the influence and interests in AT&T Research Labs (Kernighan, Ritchie, etc)\n\nUnix Tools that use Regular Expressions\nUnix Tools that use Regexes:\n\ngrep\n\nsed\n\nawk\n\nvim\n\nemacs\n\n\nBasic Regular Expressions\nBRE (Basic Regular Expressions)\nBRE . Although POSIX.2 leaves some implementation specifics undefined, BRE and ERE provide a \"standard\" which has since been adopted as the default syntax of many tools, where the choice of BRE or ERE modes is usually a supported option. For example, GNU grep has the following options: \"grep -E\" for ERE, and \"grep -G\" for BRE (the default), and \"grep -P\" for Perl regexes.\nExamples of Regular Expressions\nHere are some examples from the Regular Expressions Wikipedia Page:\n\n.at matches any three-character string ending with \"at\", including \"hat\", \"cat\", and \"bat\".\n\n[hc]at matches \"hat\" and \"cat\".\n\n[^b]at matches all strings matched by .at except \"bat\".\n\n[^hc]at matches all strings matched by .at other than \"hat\" and \"cat\".\n\n^[hc]at matches \"hat\" and \"cat\", but only at the beginning of the string or line.\n\n[hc]at$ matches \"hat\" and \"cat\", but only at the end of the string or line.\n\n\\[.\\] matches any single character surrounded by \"[\" and \"]\" since the brackets are escaped, for example: \"[a]\" and \"[b]\".\n\ns.* matches s followed by zero or more characters, for example: \"s\" and \"saw\" and \"seed\".\n\n\nExtended Regular Expressions\n\nERE (Extended Regular Expressions) adds ?, +, and |, and EREs removes the need to escape the metacharacters ( ) and { }, which are required in BREs.\n\nFurthermore, as long as the POSIX standard syntax for regexes is adhered to, there can be, and often is, additional syntax to serve specific (yet POSIX compliant) applications\n\nThe meaning of metacharacters escaped with a backslash is reversed for some characters in the POSIX Extended Regular Expression (ERE) syntax.\n\nWith this syntax, a backslash causes the metacharacter to be treated as a literal character.\n\nSo, for example, \\( \\) is now ( ) and \\{ \\} is now { }.\n\nAdditionally, support is removed for \\n backreferences and the following metacharacters are added:\n\n\n\n\n\nMetacharacter\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n?\nMatches the preceding element zero or one time. For example, ab?c matches only \"ac\" or \"abc\".\n\n\n+\nMatches the preceding element one or more times. For example, ab+c matches \"abc\", \"abbc\", \"abbbc\", and so on, but not \"ac\".\n\n\n|\nThe choice (also known as alternation or set union) operator matches either the expression before or the expression after the operator. For example, `abc\\\ndef` matches \"abc\" or \"def\".\n\n\n\nExamples of EREs\n\n[hc]?at matches \"hat\", \"cat\", and \"at\".\n\n[hc]*at matches \"hat\", \"cat\", \"hhat\", \"chat\", \"hcat\", \"cchchat\", \"at\", and so on.\n\n[hc]+at matches \"hat\", \"cat\", \"hhat\", \"chat\", \"hcat\", \"cchchat\", and so on, but not \"at\".\n\ncat|dog matches \"cat\" or \"dog\".\n\n\nFamily of Regular Expression Tools\nGrep\nDifferent Grep programs:\n\nThe grep utility searches any given input files, selecting lines that match one or more patterns.\nThe egrep interprets pattern as an extended regular expression\nForce regular grep to behave like egrep with -E flag.\n\n\nThe fgrep interprets pattern as a set of fixed strings.\nForce regular grep to behave as fgrep with -F.\n\n\nThe zgrep invokes grep on compressed or gzipped files\nForce regular grep to behave as zgrep with -Z.\n\n\nThe zegrep accept input files compressed with the compress utility\nThe zfgrep compression utilities with gzip\n\nSed\n\nSed is good for text matching and substitution\n\nThe sed utility reads the specified files, or the standard input if no files are specified, modifying the input as specified by a list of commands.\n\nThe input is then written to the standard output\n\n\nAwk\n\nPattern matching with an actual programming language\n\nAwk scans each input file for lines that match any of a set of patterns specified literally in prog or in one or more files specified as -f progfile.\n\nWith each pattern there can be an associated action that will be performed when a line of a file matches the  pattern.\n\nEach line is matched against the pattern portion of every pattern-action statement; the associated action is performed for each matched pattern.\n\nThe file name - means the standard input.\n\nAny file of the form var=value is treated as an assignment, not a filename, and is executed  at the time it would have been opened if it were a filename.\n\nThe option -v followed by var=value is an assignment to be done before prog is executed; any number of -v options may be present.\n\nThe -F fs option defines the input field separator to be the regular expression fs.\n\n\nScripting Languages with Regular Expression Flavors of their own\n\nPerl\nPython\nRuby\nJavaScript\n\nImportant Grep Options\nList of Imporant grep options:\n\n-e specify a pattern used during the search of the input: an input line is selected if it matches any of the specified patterns.\n\nThis option is most useful when multiple -e options are used to specify multiple patterns, or when a pattern begins with a dash (`-').\n\n\n-f Read one or more newline separated patterns from file.\n\nEmpty pattern lines match every input line.\nNewlines are not considered part of a pattern.\nIf file is empty, nothing is matched.\n\n\n-l Only the names of files containing selected lines are written to standard output.  grep will only search a file until a match has been found, making searches potentially less expensive.\n\nPathnames are listed once per file searched.\nIf the standard input is searched, the string ``(standard input)'' is written.\n\n\n-v Selected lines are those not matching any of the specified patterns (invert matches)\n\n-q suppress output or quiet mode\n\nOften in a shell script doing > /dev/null is more obvious to readers\n\n\n-s don't print errors\n\n\nGood Practices for Regular Expressions\n\nTry to use EREs as much as you can as their more powerful and modern machines have the capability to run them with too much performance impact.\n\nAlways quote your Regular Expressions\n\n\nSingle Character Expressions\n\nRegular characters like \"Z\" or \"&\" match themselves\n\nCharacter case matters: \"d\" and \"D\" are different\n\nPeriod (\".\") matches any single character\n\nPossibly matches newlines\n\n\n\nEscaped metacharacter:\n\n\\. matches a real period\n\\\\ matches a real backslash\n\nBracket Expressions\n\nThe brackets [ ] match any one character\nSo [abcde] matches one of the characters a, b, c, d, e respectively\nUsing a dash like this [0-9] or [A-Z] matches all characters in alphabet or numbers 0 through 9 respectively\nUsing a caret ^ in the beginning of bracket will invert matches [^cd] will match anything not c or d\n\nCharacter classes are used for digits, punctuations, letters, etc..\n\n[[:classname:]] notice the inner bracket [:classname:]\n\nCharacter Classes:\n\n'[:alnum:]'\n\nAlphanumeric characters: '[:alpha:]' and '[:digit:]'; in the 'C' locale and ASCII character encoding, this is the same as ‘[0-9A-Za-z]’.\n\n\n'[:alpha:]'\n\nAlphabetic characters: '[:lower:]' and '[:upper:]'; in the 'C' locale and ASCII character encoding, this is the same as '[A-Za-z]'.\n\n\n'[:blank:]'\n\nBlank characters: space and tab.\n\n\n'[:cntrl:]'\n\nControl characters. In ASCII, these characters have octal codes 000 through 037, and 177 (DEL).\nIn other character sets, these are the equivalent characters, if any.\n\n\n'[:digit:]'\n\nDigits: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9.\n\n\n'[:graph:]'\n\nGraphical characters: '[:alnum:]' and '[:punct:]'.\n\n\n'[:lower:]'\n\nLower-case letters; in the ‘C’ locale and ASCII character encoding, this is a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z.\n\n\n'[:print:]'\n\nPrintable characters: '[:alnum:]', '[:punct:]', and space.\n\n\n'[:punct:]'\n\nPunctuation characters; in the ‘C’ locale and ASCII character encoding, this is ! \" # $ % & ' ( ) * + , - . / : ;  ? @ [ \\ ] ^ _ ` { | } ~.\n\n\n'[:space:]'\n\nSpace characters: in the ‘C’ locale, this is tab, newline, vertical tab, form feed, carriage return, and space.\n\n\n'[:upper:]'\n\nUpper-case letters: in the ‘C’ locale and ASCII character encoding, this is A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z.\n\n\n'[:xdigit:]'\n\nHexadecimal digits: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F a b c d e f.\n\n\n\nRepetition in Grep\n\nAsterisk (*) indicates zero or more of the preceding character\nbc*d matches bd, bcd, bccd, bcccd, ...\n\n\nNotice the * matches zero or more the c characters\nit does not match bAd though it only matches with c characters\n.* matches any character though so it is most powerful match\n* matches the null string as well which can affect substitutions\n\nBasic Grep Examples\n$ echo 'Hey Marcel how are you doing?' | grep --color 'Marcel'\n\nNotice when you output this that Marcel is in color because it is a match\n$ echo 'Hey Marcel how are you doing?' | grep --color 'marcel'\n\nThis will not match though because case matters\n$ echo 'You are hungry right?' | grep --color h.ngry\n\nNotice that hungry matches because the dot . matches any character\n$ echo this is www.marcelbelmont.com domain | grep --color 'www\\.marcelbelmont\\.com'\n\nWhen you want to match a literal character such as a dot it needs to be escaped\n$ echo abc 555 | grep --color '[aeiouc]'\n\nWhat do you think will match here?\n$ echo what will match here 987 | grep --color '[^whe9]'\n\nWhat matches here?\n$ echo what is happening 587-987-1000 | grep --color '[[:digit:]]'\n\nThis matches numbers 0-9\n$ echo what should match here? 897-888-3333 | grep --color '[^[:digit:]]'\n\nWhat matches here?\necho do alphas match? 5899 | grep --color '[[:alpha:]]'\n\nThe alpha character class matches any characters in alphabet\necho do alphas match? 5899 | grep --color '[^[:alpha:]]'\n\nWhat should match here?\n$ echo what matches here 888 | grep --color '[[:alpha:]]*'\n\n$ echo 0899 matches here 888 | grep --color '[[:alpha:]]*'\n\n$ echo 159 out for this 999 | ggrep -E --color '[^[:alpha:]]*'\n\n$ echo what the 189 stuff 877 | grep --color -E '[[:digit:]]*'\n\n$ echo what the 189 stuff 877 | grep --color -E '[^[:digit:]]*'\n\nWhen using bsd grep there is what seems like subtle bugs\nI have gnu grep installed and all occurrences of  characters not in alphabet matched as they should\n\nBe aware of subtle differences between BSD Unix Tools and GNU they creep up on you.\n\nUsing --color and some sample data helps test your BREs as you write them\n\n\nInterval Expressions\n\nd\\{A\\} - A occurrences of d\nd\\{A,\\} - At least A occurrences of d\nd\\{A, B\\} - A to B occurrences of d\n\nThe d means a single character\n\n[[:digit:]]\\{3\\}-[[:digit:]]\\{4\\} this RegEx matches on a US local phone number\n\nsuch as 531-2000\n\n\nA and B are integers up to RE_DUP_MAX\n\n\nIf you are on a Mac run the following command:\n$ sysctl user.re_dup_max\nuser.re_dup_max: 255\n\nsysctl can print kernel state variables\nAnchor regex matches\n\nCaret ^ means match must start at beginning of line or string\n\nDollar Sign $ means match must occur at end of line or string\n\nif you use ^ and $ in the middle of a basic regular expression than they stand for their literal value\n\n\nParenthesized Subexpressions\n\n(o[pq])(567)yy\\2\\1 is the same as `o[pq]567yyY2Y1\n\nThe Y2 and Yq are the actual text that match expressions in parentheses\nThe contents of the parenthesis can be any regular expression\n\n\nYou can use up to 9 parenthesized subexpressions\nThis is often called \"backreferences\"\nThis only works for Basic Regular Expressions (BREs)\n\nBasic Regular Expression Operator Precedence\nI am ordering from Highest to Lowest Precedence:\n\nBracket Symbols: [:class:], [=a=], [.ab.]\n\\metacharacter\nBracket Expresssions [ ]\n(.....) and \\digit\n\nand {......}\n\n\nconcatenation (cde is c followed by d then by e)\n^ and $ anchors\n\nRegular Expression Matching\n\nRegular Expression match the longest possible, leftmost occurrence of text that can be matched\nIt is said that regular expressions are greedy by default in this way\n\n\nThe regex match stops at the first character that cannot be matched\nIf a text is matched then it is used even if a longer match exists further down the text\n\nIntermediate Grep Examples\n$ echo 891 you 588 | grep --color '[[:alpha:]]\\{2\\}'\n\nIt matches 2 characters here the yo\nbut\n$ echo 891 some 5888 | grep --color '[[:alpha:]]\\{2\\}'\n\nHere it matches the some the whole character set\n$ echo 589 him 999 | grep --color '[^[:alpha:]]\\{2\\}'\n\nHere it matches on 4 pairs:\nThe 58, 9 and space, a space and 9, and 99\n$ echo 589 him 999 | grep --color '[^[:alpha:][:space:]]\\{2\\}'\n\nHere it matched on 2 pairs:\nThe 58 and the 99\n$ echo 589 her 897 | grep --color '^[[:digit:]]*'\n\nHere it matches the digits at the beginning which happens to be 589\n$ echo her 888 | grep --color '^[^[:digit:]]*'\n\nThis matches anything that is not a digit at the beginning of the set so it matches her\n$ echo 567 vim 321 | grep --color '[^[:alpha:]]*$'\n\nThis matches any character that is not in alphabet and in the end of the set so it matches 321\n$ echo 567 abcd 789 himhim | grep --color '[aeiouhm]*'\n\n$ echo 567 abcd 789 himhim | grep --color '[aeiouhm]*'\n\nHere it didn't match with BSD grep but with gnu grep\n$ echo 567 abcd 789 himhim | ggrep --color '[aeiouhm]*'\n\nit matches with a,him, him like it should to match longest string\nThis seems to be a bug between bsd grep and gnu grep\nHere is an example using sed which will go into soon\n$ echo 567 aeod 888 houhou  | sed 's/[aeioud]*/D/'\n\nNotice a quirk here it matched on the null string which is at the beginning of the set\n$ echo 567 aeod 888 houhou  | sed 's/[aeioud][aeioud]*/D/'\n\n567 D 888 houhou\n\nHere it matched on the string aeod and replaced with D but it didn't match all occurrence because we need the g flag which does a global replace\necho 567 aeod 888 houhou  | sed 's/[aeioud][aeioud]*/D/g'\n\n567 D 888 hDhD\n\nNotice this time ou was replaced with D twice \nAlways quote your regular expressions on the command line or you will get unexpected behavior\nThings to be watch out for regular expressions:\n\nSubstitutions can match the null string in unexpected ways as you saw\n\nMatches will go with longest leftmost match\n\nRegular expressions can become cryptic very quickly so do take your time to read, write and to test them.\n\n\nExtended Regular Expressions\nSimiliarites to Basic Regular Expressions:\n\nMatching single characters\n\nRegular characters, ., escaped metacharacters\nBracket expressions: ranges and classes\n\n\nConduct repetition with * and inverval expressions ({.....})\n\nAnchor sets with ^ and $\n\nAlthough in EREs the ^ and $ are still special even in the middle of a Regular Expression\n\n\nMatches go with longest, leftmost match\n\n\nAdditional Repition Operators for EREs\n\nre? is zero or one of re\nso for example mother? would match one mother or none, meaning optional\n\n\nA note that re can be more than one character\nThis applies to * and {...} as well\n\n\n\nGrouping with Parenthesis\n\nParenthesis group smaller Regular Expressions into larger regexes\n([[:digit:]]{3}-[[:digit:]]{4})+ this matches one or more US phone numbers\nWe can even include repetition operators\n\n\nYou can't use backreferences with EREs\n\nAlternation\n\nAlternation means this or that \n(mayo|ketchup) will match either mayo or ketchup but not both\nAlternation is often used with parenthesis\n\n\nAlternation has the lowest precedence of all the operators\n^sorry|world$ will expand like this\n(^sorry)|(world$) and not like this ^(sorry|world)$ as you would think due to operator precedence\n\n\n\n\n\nExtended Regular Expressions Operator Precedence\nOperator Precedence:\n\nBracket symbols: [:class:], [=c=], [.bs.], and [012345]\nMeaning the brackets themselves [  ]\n\n\n\\metacharacter\nBracket expressions

matches ac and abc since ac does not have a b and it matched abc since it was one b\n$ echo ac abc abbc abbbc | grep -E --color 'ab?c'\n\nthis also works because -E puts grep in ERE mode\necho abc 531-2000 531-7777 cba | egrep --color '([[:digit:]]{3}-[[:digit:]]{4} )+\n\nThis uses grouping operator () and matches 3 digits, a - and 4 digits respectively\necho 'yo man\nhow are you' | egrep --color 'how|yo'\n\nThis matches yo twice once in yo and second in you and it matches how\n$ echo word and up | egrep --color '^word|up$'\n\nThis matches both word and up because of operator precedence\n$ echo word and up | egrep --color '^(word|up)$'\n\nThis doesn't match because we have more in the line than just word or up\necho abc 888-7777 999-1111 cba |\ngrep --color '\\([[:digit:]]\\{3\\}-[[:digit:]]\\{4\\} \\)\\+'\n\nThis matches using regular `grep with backslashes and interval expressions and grouping expressions and the plus operator\necho 'yo\nman\nhey' | grep --color '^\\(yo\\|man\\)$'\n\nNotice here that we need to escape with \\ but we match with yo, man\nNotice an example with sed and gsed\n$ echo yo and hey | sed 's/^yo\\|hey$/zzz/g'\n\nthis should have worked and replaced both yo and hey with zzz\nbut this example with gnu sed works\necho yo and hey | gsed 's/^yo\\|hey$/zzz/g'\nzzz and zzz\n\nMain programs that use EREs\n\negrep\ngrep with -E\nawk\nGNU grep and sed let you use \\?, \\+ and \\| to get the same ERE power but is not readable\n\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← Basics of Shell Programming\nText

Examples\nBest Practices for Sed\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\nWhat is Sed\nSed (stream editor) is a Unix utility that parses and transforms text, using a simple, compact programming language. \nSed was developed by Lee McMahon in 1974.\nSed was the one of the first tools that supported regular expressions\nThe sed utility reads the specified files, or the standard input if no files are specified, modifying the input as specified by a list of commands.  \nThe input is then written to the standard output.\n\nSed can get input from command line files and/or standard input\n\nSed can use editing command from the command line and/or script\n\nSed outputs to standard output but original input files are changed\n\nYou can edit a file in place if you use -i option which will create a backup file and then edit file in place\n\n\nCommandline Options to Sed\nThe following options are available:\n\n-E Interpret regular expressions as extended (modern) regular expressions rather than basic regular expressions (BRE's).\n\n-r can be used in gnu sed\n\n\n-a The files listed as parameters for the w functions are created (or truncated) before any processing begins, by default.  \n\nThe * -a option causes sed to delay opening each file until a command containing the related ``w'' function is applied to a line of input.\n\n\n-e command\n\nAppend the editing commands specified by the command argument to the list of commands.\n\n\n-f command_file\n\nAppend the editing commands found in the file command_file to the list of commands.  \nThe editing commands should each be listed on a separate line.\n\n\n-i extension\n\nEdit files in* -place, saving backups with the specified extension.  \nIf a zero* -length extension is given, no backup will be saved.\nIt is not recommended to give a zero -length extension when in -place editing files,  as you risk corruption or partial content in situations where disk space is exhausted, etc.\n\n\n-l Make output line buffered.\n\n-n By default, each line of input is echoed to the standard output after all of the commands have been applied to it.  The * -n option suppresses this behavior.\n\n\nYou can mix -e and -f options together\nIf you don't provide options then first command line argument is the script\nBasic Sed Usage\nSed Manual\nsed [-Ealn] [-e command] [-f command_file] [-i extension] [file ...]\nAlthough sed has a large command set be wary of writing unwieldy scripts as they will be hard to read for others\nThe primary command is \"s\" (substitute) that does text replacements\nSed command structure\n\n  [  [  ] ]\n\n\n\none or two line numbers and use $ to mean last line\nPattern to match aka basic regular expression\n\n\n\n\nA single letter: s and p are most useful\n\n\n\n\nIn particular for s is the pattern to match and replacement text\nOther commands can take other operands\n\n\n\n\nFlags serve as modifiers for s command\n\n\n\nSubstitute command structure\ns  /  pattern  / replacement  / [flags]\nThe delimiter can be any punctuation character but the / is the most common delimiter\n\nUse \\/ in patter or replacement for real / (forward slash) or another delimiter\n\npattern is a basic regular expression\n\nreplacement is the text to replace the matched input text\n\nFlags are optional modifiers\n\n\nSubstitute and Replacement text\nReplacement text can be:\n\nEmpty which means the matched text is deleted\n\nPlain Text which means matched text is replaced by contents of plain text\n\n& which means the text matching the pattern \n\necho you are the man | sed 's/you are the/& goat/g'\nNotice in this example the & was used as replacement text for the pattern text used\n\n\n\n\n\\& means a real &\n\n\\1 through \\9 is for text matched in \\(....\\) in the BRE (basic regular expression)\n\n\\\\ means a real \\ backslash\n\n\nSubstitute Flags\n\nAn optional flags will modify the behavior of the s command\n\nThe default behavior of substitution is to only replace the first occurrence\n\n\nPortable flags to use across various flavors of sed:\n\ng flag will replace every match on the input line\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or nth digit replace the nth occurrence\n\ni will ignore case but only works in gnu sed\n\n\nSed Examples\nExamples with s\n$ grep '2017-08-22' data/aapl.csv | sed 's/,.*//'\n\nNotice in this example we use grep to find the date 2017-08-22 and then pipe output to sed and remove everything after the comma\n$ sed 's/Liam/Frank/g' data/top-10-baby-names-2016.txt | sed 's/Charlotte/Katy/g'\n\nIn this example we use sed to replace the baby name Liam with Frank and then pipe that as stdin to replace Charlotte into Katy\n$ sed 's/Liam/Frank/g' data/top-10-baby-names-2016.txt | sed '/Charlotte/d'\n\nThis example changed Liam to Frank and then deleted the line for Charlotte\n$ sed 's/^/      /g' data/numbers.txt\n\nThis example prepends 8 spaces to beginning of line in numbers.txt\nExamples for filtering text\n$ sed -n '/Jacob/p' data/top-10-baby-names-2016.txt > data/jacob.txt\n\nThis example suppresses all output except matched text and prints it to stdout and then creates file called jacob.txt\nThere is a many more examples of sed usage this is just a sample.\nBest practices with Sed:\n\nThe longest, left-most matching basic regular expressions is critical for proper sed usage\n\nUse basic regular expressions over extended regular expressions and only use simple sed commands for portability and readability\n\nMake sure to use edit commands on teh sed command line to make sustainable scripts\n\nsed is mainly used for text substitutions\n\nsed is used a lot in scripts with pattern matching and text replacement or deletion of text via substitution\n\nsed is often used in the middle of shell pipelines to transform data\n\n\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← Text

Expansion\nThe ~ is shorthand for a users home directory\n\n~/somefile is shorthand for a file in current users home directory\nIn my mac book ~ is short for /Users/marcelbelmont so ~/somefile would expand to /Users/marcelbelmont/somefile\nIn linux machines usually ~ would be /home/someuser\n\n\n~someuser/somefile would be for a file in a specific users home directory\ncd ~marcelbelmont/code-craftsmanship-organization/\nthis command would expand to cd /Users/marcelbelmont/code-craftsmanship-organization\n\n\n\n\nCommon extensions:\n~+ will use the current directory\n~- will use the previous directory\n\n\nThe tilde ~ will expand after variable expansion so you could do cd ~$USER which would work\n\nWildcards\nWildcards are like regular expressions but are simpler\nWildcards are used for file names while regular expressions are typically used for file contents\n\n* asterisk matches any sequence of characters much like use in regular expressions\n\nls .* will print out all hidden files in current directory\n\n\n? will match any single character like the . dot in regular expressions\n\nBracket expressions are like the regular expressions bracket expressions\n\nRanges and [[:class:]]\nBig difference is the complement though\nUse [!...] instead of [^...] to complement\n\n\n\n\nAnchoring is done implicitly\n\n*.c => ^.*\\.c$\nremember the ^ and $ will anchor the name to this\nlike word.c or something\n\n\n\n\n\nHidden Files\nBy convention files and directories whose names start with a dot are not shown by either ls and are not matched by wildcards\nIf you want to see hidden files pass -a flag which means \"all\"\n\nls -a will print out all the files\n\n$ ls -a\n.  ..  .git  .gitignore  LICENSE  README.md  SUMMARY.md  _book

this command prints out all the hidden files/directories that start with .bash\nBest Practices\n\nYou need to be very carefule with spaces and *\n\n`rm *  .o\nthis will remove all files and then try to delete .o but that is already deleted\n\n\nMake sure to quote wildcard characters if you want to use them literally\n\nOlder shells don't support tilde expansion even though tilde expansion is part of the POSIX standard.\n\nIf you run scripts in a older shell then they may fail\n\n\nExtended Pattern Matching\nExtended Pattern Matching is availabe in Bash, ksh, zsh and probably other shells\nExtended Pattern is not part of the POSIX standard\nDon't rely on extended pattern matching though for portability though as some shells may not have it\nExtended patterns provide similar power that extended regular expressions provide\nExtended Pattern matching is a more powerful filename matching mechanism\nExtended Pattern Notations\n\n\n\nPattern\nERE equivalent\nExplanation\n\n\n\n\n*(exp)\nexp*\nmeans zero or more of an exp\n\n\n+(exp)\nexp+\nmeans one or more of an exp\n\n\n?(exp)\nexp?\nmeans zero or one of exp\n\n\n@(exp1|exp2|...|expn)\nexp1 pipe exp2\nThis is alternation\n\n\n!(exp)\nNo equivalent notation\nmeans complement of exp\n\n\n\nEnable Pattern matching\nUse command shopt in bash\n$ shopt --help\nshopt: shopt [-pqsu] [-o] [optname ...]\n    Set and unset shell options.\n\n    Change the setting of each shell option OPTNAME.

data/population.txt\n\nIn this example we first delete Russia from cities.txt and then pipe this as stdin for join but it fails with join because we didn't sort the contents of the file cities.txt and when it encountered the file population.txt which wasn't sorted either it looked for a key Russia but didn't find it.\nsort data/cities.txt > data/cities.sorted.txt\n\nHere we sort cities.txt\nsort data/population.txt > data/population.sorted.txt\n\nand here we sort population.txt\nsed '/^Russia/d' data/cities.sorted.txt | join - data/population.sorted.txt\n\nThis command will pass because both files have been sorted and when join encounters key Russia that is not found it simply omits Russia from Output because population and cities didn't have the shared key anymore\nUsages for Cut and Join\n\nCut is a focused tool for a special task\nCut is a special command that cuts out either delimiter-separated fields or a range of characters\nCut is much simpler than sed and is used to extract individual fields from a file\nAlso there is some locale issues when cutting by a charactere so be cognizant of that\n\n\nJoin is also a focused tool for a special task\nJoin is a special command that selectively merges related data based on corresponding keys\nJoin must be sorted on the key field\nRemember from the example above we had to sort it, if you don't sort it may or may not work as was evidenced on the first sort example so always sort to avoid unexpected behavior\n\n\n\nAwk Description\nawk - pattern-directed scanning and processing language\nAwk scans each input file for lines that match any of a set of patterns specified literally in prog or in one or more files specified as -f progfile.  \nWith each pattern there can be an associated action that will be performed when a line of a file matches the pattern.\nEach  line  is  matched  against  the  pattern  portion of every pattern-action statement; the associated action is performed for each\nmatched pattern.  \nThe file name - means the standard input.  Any file of the form var=value is treated as an assignment, not  a  filename, and is executed at the time it would have been opened if it were a filename.  \nThe option -v followed by var=value is an assign-\nment to be done before prog is executed; any number of -v options may be present.  \nThe -F fs option defines the input field  separator\nto be the regular expression fs\nAwk options\n$ awk

of awk\nawk has several distributions:\n\nawk bsd style\nnawk is a version written by one of the original authors Brian Kernighan\ngawk is gnu awk and here is the Gawk Docs\nmawk is fast awk implementation\nlibmawk is a fork of mawk\nawka\ntawk\njawk\nxgawk\nqseawk\nImplementation of awk written by BusyBox\n\nWe will mainly look at bsd version of awk and gawk\nPatterns and Actions in Awk\nAwk programs operate on a series of patterns and actions\n$1 === \"marcel\" { increment_user++ }\nHere is an example\n\nPatterns in awk are done:\n\nRegular expression matching\n\nString Comparision\nNumber Comparison\nGeneral Test\nExtended Regular expressions\n\nawk actions are enclosed in braces and can do any computation\nVariables in awk are automatically initialized to 0 or \"\"\nEither the pattern or the action may be omitted in awk\nPatterns in Awk Docs\nActions in Awk Docs\nAwk Program Flow\n\nawk processes command line options and parses program text\nawk will execute any startup actions\nawk will loop until it is done\nawk will read a record\nawk will split a record into fields\nawk will test each pattern (your program code) against a record.\nawk will run corresponding action if the action matches\n\n\nawk will execute any cleanup actions\n\nAwk fields\nAn input line in awk is known as a record\nRecords in awk consist of fields that are separated by whitespace\nYou can set field separators on the command line  or use FS variable\nIn awk you use the variables $1, $2, ... , $n and so on for each field\nNF is the number of fields in a current record\nYou can use NF for the last field in a record\nYou use $0 for the whole record in awk\nSet Field Separator in awk\nYou can set field separator in 2 places:\n\ncommand line wth -F option\n\nawk -F: 'some program text' /etc/passwd | some pipe operation\n\n\nIn an awk program.\n\nYou assign a string to FS\n3 different \"modes\" in awk:\nFS = \" \" number of whitespace separated fields\nFS = \"character\" Number of instances of character separated fields\nFS = \"re\" Each field separated by text that matches \"re\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinting lines in Awk\nprint statements only appear in the actions parts in awk\nThe print statement is mainly used for simple formatting\nprint \"Order\", $2, \"Amount:\", $1\nThe printf statement is used for formatted text\nprintf(\"Order: %s\\tAmount: %g\\n\", $2, $1)\nprintf docs\nMany languages have a printf function\nAs you saw earlier in the workshop you need to put \\n in printf to print a final newline\nAwk Startup and Cleanup Actions\nStartup and Cleanup\nBegin and End Rules\nYou provide code that runs before reading any records like so:\nBEGIN {\n  code here ...\n}\n\nYou then can provide code to run after all the records have been processed\nEND {\n  code here ...\n}\n\nThe keywords BEGIN and END can begin anywhere in your awk program.\nBEGIN and END can be used multiple times in an awk program.\nFurthermore BEGIN and END are run in the order that they appear in your awk program\nAwk examples\nawk -F , '{ print $2 }' data/information.txt\n\nThe field separator is , is in this awk program\nHere is a breakdown of each field:\n\nName\nRank\nHeight\nYears of Service\n\nIt prints out the Rank field here\nawk -F : '{ print $1 }' /etc/passwd\n\nThis awk command line program sets field separator to :, then it prints out the first field for each record of /etc/passwd\nsed -n '25p' /etc/passwd\n\nNotice with sed we print the 25th line of /etc/passwd\nwhich has the following content:\n_serialnumberd:*:58:58:Serial Number Daemon:/var/empty:/usr/bin/false\nHere is a breakdown of each field:\n\n_serialnumberd\n*\n58\n58\nSerial Number Daemon\n/var/empty\n/usr/bin/false\n\nSo in total there is 7 fields in each record that is field separated with : character\nsed '/^#/d' /etc/passwd | awk -F : '{ print $6 }'\n\nWhat do you think gets printed in this awk program?\nawk -F : '$NF ~ /\\/bin\\/sh/ { print $1 }' /etc/passwd\n\nThis script counts with $NF which is a special variable in awk the number of records that have users that use /bin/sh. Notice here that I had to escape the / with a \\ to get the literal /. Also remember $1 is the first field of the record\nawk -F : '$5 ~ /PostgreSQL Server/' /etc/passwd\n\nThis awk program looks in the 5th field for each record for the pattern /PostgreSQL Server/ using the ~ operator and then prints out the entire record that matched\nawk -F : '$5 ~ /PostgreSQL Server/ { print $1 }' /etc/passwd\n\nThis example explicitly prints out first field _postgres because we used the curly braces and the print command\ncat data/orders.txt\nID,ORDER DESCRIPTION,PRICE\n1,Hamburger,2.50\n2,Fries,1.00\n3,Hamburger,2.50\n4,Shake,2.75\n5,Fries,1.00\n6,Hamburger,2.75\n\nThis simple file has a list of orders\nawk -F ',' '$2 ~ /Hamburger/ { total += $3 } END { print \"total: \", total }' data/orders.txt\n\nThis awk program sets , as field delimiter and then searches in the second field for the pattern Hamburger and then it creates variable total that sums up 3rd field which is the price and then prints the total in the end.\n./scripts/working-with-fields/bank_statement.sh data/bank_statement.csv\n\nWe will look at this script and explain contents line by line but one thing we will discuss is that the first line has a shebang and takes the -f option because we will provide a data file to it.\nTips for awk programs\nRemember when using regular expression matching and string comparison in awk programs that locales come into effect.\nWhen using multiple source files with awk you need to order them correctly in the command line\nRemember for portability that certain flavors of awk have different features so try not to use to many special functions if your script is to be used across many environments\nIf portability is not a real issue then try to use gnu awk as it is the most feature rich version of awk\nThe concept of patterns and actions in awk brings a powerful abilithy to describe data that needs to be processed.\nSince awk automatically reads records and performs field splitting you can focus on your data and what to do with your data\nAlso awk is a much more powerful unix tool than sed as it is a turing complete programming language and sed is just a streaming editor at heart\nExtended regular expressions give awk more power\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← Filename expansions and globbing\nText Sorting →\n\n\n\n"},"docs/text-sorting.html":{"url":"docs/text-sorting.html","title":"Text Sorting","keywords":"","body":"Unix Programming and Regular Expressions Workshop - Text Sorting\nSections:\n\nSort description\nSort by line\nSort by field\nSort Field Specifications\nSort options\nSort examples\nSort best practices\nUniq description\nUniq options\nUniq examples\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\nSort description\nsort - sort lines of text files\nsort writes sorted concatenation of all FILE(s) to standard output.\nThe process of sorting will gather related data for further processing in a pipeline\nSome uses for sorting:\n\nTo count the number of occurrences of some data\nTo remove duplicates of data\nTo process related items together\n\nSorting can be thought of as a key operation for any complicated pipeline\nSort by line\nThe default behavior for sort is to sort by comparing full lines\nImportant note: sort order is defined by the current locale\nIf you export LC_ALL=C then it will compare by byte values\nThe default behavior is to keep duplicate line in stdout\n2 ways to get unique ways with text in sorted values:\n\nIf you pass -u then it will only print unique values\n\nIf you pipe sorted text to uniq unix command\n\n\nSort by field\nFields are separated by whitespace characters but leading and trailing whitespace are ignored.\nThe -t flag is used to specify a field separator\nThe -k is used to define sorting criteria for each field\nsort will sort by the first field, then by the second, ..., until it is done\nSort Field Specifications\n\nField numbers start at one\nYou specify character position within a field using .N and N start at field one\n\n-k has a start and end in order to start and end positions for each sort criteria\nEach field specification can be specified with an optional letter:\n\nn for numeric\nr to reverse\nf to fold case\n\nSort options\nOrdering options:\n\n-b, --ignore-leading-blanks\nignore leading blanks\n\n\n-d, --dictionary-order\nconsider only blanks and alphanumeric characters\n\n\n-f, --ignore-case\nfold lower case to upper case characters\n\n\n-g, --general-numeric-sort\ncompare according to general numerical value\n\n\n-i, --ignore-nonprinting\nconsider only printable characters\n\n\n-M, --month-sort\ncompare (unknown) \n\n\n-n, --numeric-sort\ncompare according to string numerical value\n\n\n-r, --reverse\nreverse the result of comparisons\n\n\n-c, --check\ncheck whether input is sorted;

If output_file is absent, standard output is used for output.\nThe second and succeeding copies of identical adjacent input lines are not written.\nRepeated lines in the input will not be detected if

consist of regular shell variables(baz=BAZ)\nCommand line argument like this:\n\n$1, ... $n\n$#\n$#,\n$@,\n$*\nWe have discusses these already earlier\n\n$? ==> this gives you exit status code\n\n\nParameter expansion is the way you get values from different parameters\nCommand line arguments\n\n$1, ..., ${8} is individual positional parameters\n$@ and $* will get all arguments but their expansion will behave differently in quotes as was discussed earlier in the workshop\n$# is the count of command line arguments\nshift command will drop an argument from left side and decrement $# and is used in shell scripts\n$0 is the name of the shell program or could a function\n$- will give options given to shell at invocation awk -f\n$$ will show process ID of current shell process\n$? will show exit status of last background command\n$! will show process ID of last background command\n$HOME is the current users home directory for example my home is /Users/marcelbelmont\n$IFS is the set input field separator characters\n$ENV is the startup file for interactive shells\n\nSimple Parameter Expansion\nAs you have seen already to get variable value you need to precede $ to variable name like $HOME\nIf you want to use a variable but it is enclosed in a variable\necho \"my home directory is ${HOME}\"\nmy home directory is /Users/marcelbelmont\n\n\n\n\nOperator\nAction\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\n${var:-word}\nIf the variable exists and is not null return it else return the word\nIts purpose is to return if a variable is not defined\n\n\n${var:=word}\nIf var exists and is not null return it else assign word\nIts purpose is to set a variable to a default value if it is not defined already\n\n\n${var:?message}\nIf var exists and is not null return it else print message\nIts purpose is to catch errors if a variable is not defined\n\n\n${var:+word}\nIf var exists and is not null return the word else return null\nIts purpose is to test if a variable exists and has a value\n\n\n\nOther types of expansions\n\n\n\nOperator\nAction\n\n\n\n\n${var#pattern}\ndelete shortest matching text from front of value\n\n\n${var##pat}\ndelete longest text from front of value\n\n\n${var%pattern}\ndelete shortest matching text from end of value\n\n\n${var%%pattern}\ndelete longest matching text from end of value\n\n\n\nParameter expansion examples\necho $HOME\n\nThis expansion prints out /Users/marcelbelmont\nsleep 3 & echo $!\n\nThis command sleeps for 3 seconds and prints out job process number. The echo $! prints out the last process id of job running in the background.\nNotice that when the job finishes we run echo $! and the PID (Process Identification Number) is still the same.\necho _$USER_\n\nThis just prints out _\necho _${USER}_\n_marcelbelmont_\n\nThis works because variable expansion \ngrep '^four' data/numbers.txt; echo $?\n\nThis prints out 1 which means grep failed\necho My PID is $$\nMy PID is 1596\n\nThis show PID for the current shell sessiono\nWe can confirm this with the ps command\nps\n  PID TTY           TIME CMD\n  406 ttys000    0:00.03 /Applications/iTerm.app/Contents/MacOS\n  410 ttys000    0:00.60 -zsh\n 1596 ttys001    0:00.82 /usr/local/bin/zsh -l\n\nNotice here that 1596 is the PID for our current shell session as we expect\necho ${number:-0}\n0\n\nSince number does not exist, echo returns 0\necho ${number:=0}\n\nThis returns 0 since number is not set but it sets number to 0.\nnumber=10\n\necho ${number:=0}\n\nThis time echo prints out 10 since number is set\necho ${number:-0}\n\nThis also prints out 10 since number has been set\nmypath=/Users/marcelbelmont/code/very.long.file.name\n\necho ${mypath#/*/}\nmarcelbelmont/code/very.long.file.name\n\nThis prints out everything minus /Users/\necho ${mypath##/*/}\nvery.long.file.name\n\nNotice here that expansion just prints last part of file\necho ${mypath%.*}\n/Users/marcelbelmont/code/very.long.file\n\nNotice that this removes .name or the shortest matching part\necho ${mypath%%.*}\n/Users/marcelbelmont/code/very\n\n Notice this removed the longest matching part long.file.name\n Using these expansions let you avoid using basename and dirname which need to be run a separate process so these expansions can make your shell scripts more efficient with resources.\nParameter expansion best practices\n\nRemember that when you use $@ and $* there is quoting quirks\n$$ will often be used when creating temporary filenames\nmktemp is a better command to use for this purpose\n\n\nIn general the most useful general expansion is ${value:-someval} and ${value:=somevalue}\nThe ${var#pattern} type parameter expansions can be good for manipulating pathnames and filenames\n\nArithmetic Expansion\nThis type of expansion because expr is harder to use\nIn order to do arithmetic expansion use $(( expression )) to get the result of an arithmetic into a command line expression or for a variable assignment\n\nYou can access variable values by preceding with or without the $\n\nThe $((  expression )) acts like double quotes\n\nResult is placed into a command line but side-effects are possible through variable assignment\n\n\nArithmetic Operator Table\n\n\n\nOperator\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n++ --\nIncrement / decrement\n\n\n+ -\nUnary plus, minus, logical and bitwise negation\n\n\n* / %\nMultiply, Divide, Remainder\n\n\n+ -\nBinary addition, Binary subtraction\n\n\n >>\nLeft Shift, Right Shift\n\n\n  > >=\nComparison Operators\n\n\n== !=\nEqual, Not Equal\n\n\n&\nBitwise AND\n\n\n^\nBitwise Exclusive OR\n\n\n|\nBitwise OR\n\n\n&&\nLogical AND (Short Circuit)\n\n\n||\nLogical OR (Short Circuit)\n\n\n?:\nConditional Expression\n\n\n= += -= *= /= %= etc\nAssignment Operators\n\n\n\nLet Command\nThe let \"expression\" is used for arithmetic\n\nIts purpose is to do arithmetic and to test result in a if statement or loop\n\nExit status is 0 for non-zero result and 1 for zero result so this is inverse of shell success status which returns 0 for success\n\n\nthe let expression works same as $(( expression ))\n\nThere is an alternate syntax in bash (( expression )) with no preceding $ this is not defined in POSIX so may not work in other shells\n\nThis alternate syntax was designed to make shell scripts look like regular programming languages\n\n\nArithmetic Expansion Examples\namount=100\n\npercent=15\n\necho Total: $((  amount + ( (amount * percent) / 100) ))\n\nHere we use $(( )) notation to save arithmetic value\nj=50\n\necho my answer is $(( ++j ))\n51\n\nUsing prefix operator we increment j and save it to j variable\necho $j\n51\n\ni=30\n\necho my answer is $(( i++ ))\nmy answer is 30\n\nThe difference in postfix operator is that i returns 30 but when we inspect i it was incremented to 31\necho $i\n31\n\nz=10\n\necho $(( z += 2 ))\n12\n\nHere += assigns 12 to z\nmysolution=13\n\nNow let us use if condition to check\nif (( mysolution == 8 ))\nthen\necho \"This is my solution\"\nelse\necho \"what did my solution end up being?\"\nfi\n\nNotice here use ((  )) to check if mysolution is equal to 8 or not\nArithmetic Expansion Best Practices\nArithmetic expansion is used to perform arithmetic instead of using expr command\nPOSIX restricts arithmetic to C language long integers\nYou can use let nd (( expression )) in bash and zsh but this notation isn't necessarily portable to other shells\nArithmetic expansion helps provide integer arithmetic using a notation familiar to other programming languages\nBuilt-in math is much faster and easier to use than expr command\nBuilt-in math is easier to write and read\nBash and zsh also provide commands for arithmetic that can be used in if, while and until loops\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← Text Sorting\nDecision Making and Exit Status

-e \"$1\" ]\n then\n   exit\n fi\n\nRemember that $# tells how many arguments were given to shell -lt stands for less than and -o stands for binary or operator and remember that ! is logical negation.\nThis is checking whether arguments is less than 2 or if the file doesn't exist if any of these are true then exit the script.\nString comparisions use the following operators:\n\n=\n!=\n\n>\n\nThere aren't any operators like  or >= for some reason\nString Arguments#String_arguments)\nNon-POSIX options:\n\n-a is and \n-o is or\n\nThese operations can be troublesome\nThe man pages have bugs section detailing possible issues:\n\nBoth sides are always evaluated in -a and -o.  For instance, the writable status of file will be tested by the following command even though the former expression indicated false, which results in a gratuitous access to the file system:\n    [ -z abc -a -w file ]\nTo avoid this, write\n    [ -z abc ] && [ -w file ]\n\nIt is preferable to use && and || over these operators for this reason\nTest Command Options\nFile Level Tests:\n\n-e True if file exists (regardless of type).\n-r True if file exists and is readable.\n-w True if file exists and is writable.

If N is specified, break N enclosing\nloops.\nExit Status:\nThe exit status is 0 unless N is not greater than or equal to 1.\nThe Break Command is usually used to break out of a loop in the middle of the body\nThe break command \"breaks out of a loop\"\nwhile something is true\ndo\n  some stuff here\n  if condition is true; then\n    break\n  fi\n  some more stuff\ndone\n\nNotice here the keyword break\nYou can provide a break level for example if you have 2 for loops and the break is inside of the second for loop break 2 will break out of the outer loop as well\nContinue Command\ncontinue: continue [n]\nResume for, while, or until loops.\nResumes the next iteration of the enclosing FOR, WHILE or UNTIL loop.\nIf N is specified, resumes the Nth enclosing loop.\nExit Status:\nThe exit status is 0 unless N is not greater than or equal to 1.\nThe continue statement is used to skip the rest of the loop body and go back to the condition of the loop\nwhile something is true\ndo\n  some stuff here\n  if condition is true; then\n    continue\n  fi\n  some more stuff\ndone\n\nYou can pass an integer with the continue command like this continue 2 and it will break out of the second level of the loop just as I described in the break statement section\nShift Command\nshift: shift [n]\nShift positional parameters.\nRename the positional parameters $N+1,$N+2 ... to $1,$2 ...
